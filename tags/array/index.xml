      <description>Time to market is a very important part of the life of the developers. In the agile world, a team must make a balance between speed and code quality. This does not necessarily mean that the code will not be good nor tested, but sometimes it limits exploration. A limited exploration means that a developer will do things the way he/she is used to.
At least from my experience, SQL is taught in university/courses in an outdated way, where a lot of new features are never explored and people are not aware of this.</description>
