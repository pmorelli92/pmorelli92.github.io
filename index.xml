      <description>Hey! Nice to see you around here. I am Pablo Morelli 🧔🏻 and I work as a backend developer at Record Union. Currently living in Stockholm 🇸🇪 but was born and lived most of my life in Buenos Aires 🇦🇷. Coding since 2010, and with most of my experience on .NET (and .NET Core) I am looking towards getting more knowledgeable regarding other stacks. My aim here is to write (mostly) about tech problems and possible solutions to them.</description>
