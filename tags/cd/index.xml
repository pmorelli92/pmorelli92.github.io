      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2021 update: Since KubeSail was not working as expected, the solution is now hosted in Okteto which offers a free namespace for developers to try out a hosted Kubernetes service.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every company has a different way to work and configure CI/CD, and all of them have pros and cons. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with Azure Pipelines before (but when it was called VSTS and the configuration was done in a more visual way and not with yaml files). Now I am currently working with Travis for CI and Flux for CD but I think it is always good to keep an eye on how the competitors are doing and what they have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
