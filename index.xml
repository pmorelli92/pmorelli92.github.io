It may sound irrelevant to bother with this when you are learning the language; but, every time I am browsing .net core applications or libraries on GitHub, I find it extremely unappealing when certain projects are not structured in a conventional way.
My starting point was the following talk:</description>

      <description>Hey! Nice to see you around here. I am Pablo Morelli 🧔🏻 and I work as a backend developer at Record Union. Currently living in Stockholm 🇸🇪 but was born and lived most of my life in Buenos Aires 🇦🇷. Coding since 2010, and with most of my experience on .NET (and .NET Core) I am looking towards getting more knowledgeable regarding other stacks. My aim here is to write (mostly) about tech problems and possible solutions to them.</description>
