      <description>One of the things that shocked me the most when I changed from C# to Golang is that developers are reluctant of adding libraries to solve problems unless it is strictly needed. This sentiment, at first annoying, turned out to be one of the things I liked the most about Go. The standard library alone is very powerful and you can achieve most of the stuff just with it.
However, there was a little something that my mind keep thinking: it would be super good to have swagger docs out of the box like in C#.</description>
