      <description>Hey! Nice to see you around here. I am Pablo Morelli üßîüèª and I work as a backend developer at Record Union. Currently living in Stockholm but was born and lived most of my life in Buenos Aires (Argentina). Coding since 2010, and with most of my experience on .NET (and .NET Core) I am looking towards expanding my horizons across other stacks. My aim here is to write (mostly) about tech problems and possible solutions to them.</description>
