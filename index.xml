      <description>The newly released dotnet 3 preview 6 has an interesting feature called publish single file where an application can be published as a binary that will run on the platform it was compiled for.
The difference of a self contained app and publish single file is that the first one is a compressed binary that will be decompressed when ran. The second one is a binary that just contains our application.</description>

      <description>Generally speaking, most organisations do not check if a commit is signed or not. Even worse, more companies do not care about this. It might subjective but I like to have the verified badge.
 If you commit from GitHub, for example: adding or editing a README, you will get the verified bagde. The same will happen with the client GitKraken, but if you commit using the git cli this will not happen unless you configure it.</description>

      <description>One day I was given the task of doing a whiteboard word counter algorithm. The requirements were:
 Print on console all the words and the quantity of times they appear on a 40.000 lines input. Make it as fast as possible.  For a start we can do it as simple as possible instead, and then try to see whether we can make it faster:
func main() { fmt.</description>

      <description>When I started learning Golang (a couple of months ago) one of the things that I concerned most with was the project structure.
It may sound irrelevant to bother with this when you are learning the language; but, every time I am browsing .net core applications or libraries on GitHub, I find it extremely unappealing when certain projects are not structured in a conventional way.
My starting point was the following talk:</description>

      <description>Hey! Nice to see you around here. I am Pablo Morelli 🧔🏻 and I work as a backend developer at Lendo. Currently living in Stockholm 🇸🇪 but was born and lived most of my life in Buenos Aires 🇦🇷. Coding since 2010, and with most of my experience on .NET (and .NET Core) I am looking towards getting more knowledgeable regarding other stacks. My aim here is to write (mostly) about tech problems and possible solutions to them.</description>
