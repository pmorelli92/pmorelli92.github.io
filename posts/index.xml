            <description>Without any doubts the year 2020 is one everyone is going to remember and it will appear in the history books (and wikipedia). Amidst so much chaos, the established way of working was forced to change, and companies that before rejected work from home had to adapt. In this way, teams that before shared a room and suffered unnecessary meetings, now started functioning as distributed teams (or distributed systems), that share a queue of messages using tools like email and slack (async communication) - and have meetings with lesser frequency (sync communication).</description>

Amidst so much chaos, the established way of working was forced to change, and companies that before rejected work from home had to adapt. In this way, teams that before shared a room and suffered unnecessary meetings, now started functioning as distributed teams (or distributed systems), that share a queue of messages using tools like email and slack (async communication) - and have meetings with lesser frequency (sync communication).</p>
<p>Great part of the IT industry agree with remote work, and beside topics like if the employer should pay for employees' monitors and internet there is not any major complain.</p>
<p>If one make the assumption that a distribute team is better, can one also assume that a company using microservices is better? The answer is surely not black or white as there are certain topics to analyze.</p>
<p>In the next paragraphs you will find &ldquo;the good, the bad and the ugly&rdquo; of the microservices. This is an extract of two podcast episodes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/stream404">Stream 404</a>, a channel on which, me and my friends, stream monthly about different IT topics. The content of the episodes is on spanish, so the extract will be on english to cover a broader audience.</p>

<h2 id="the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly">The good, the bad and the ugly</h2>
<p>Title of an old film and also of a <a href="https://www.funretrospectives.com/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/">retrospective</a>, consists on naming good things (that the team should repeat), bad things (that should have never happened) and ugly things (which the team need to work with to make beautiful).</p>
<p>Applying this to microservices one can name:</p>
<ul>
<li>The good things of using them.</li>
<li>The bad things as problems to avoid.</li>
<li>The ugly things as transitions and changes of paradigms that the team has to face.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-good">The good</h2>
<p>SOLID, a set of principles that apply to programming languages, establishes the &ldquo;Single Responsibility Principle&rdquo; (SRP): A class, file or package (depending on the language) must have an unique reason for changing. Microservices should take advantage of SRP to delimit the scope of a service and encapsulate that code within. In this way, the discoverability of certain functionality is way easier.</p>
<p>The development lifecycle is shorter. When the scope of the microservice is well delimited, it should not take more than two weeks (from book to reality it may vary) which makes it easier to replace in case one needs another implementation.</p>
<p>Following the same line of thinking, a service with a delimited scope is easier to test; a good base of unit tests which guarantee that the business rules are valid is fundamental for ensuring that the system works as expected.</p>
<p>Lastly, in bigger companies where every team represents a function, is common to find no more than six people specifically working in one or two services and having total freedom to develop them - without breaking any contract constraint established with other services of other teams.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The bad</h2>
<p>Hashtags. It may sound ridiculous but to get people into start-ups there are teams that just try to do microservices, without considering the advantages / disadvantages, because they are trendy. The stigma of the monoliths is such that mentioning them cause pain. In a new company or in a new project, where the business is not super well defined and/or stable, the best alternative is to start with a monolith and then migrate to microservices.</p>
<p>The tooling (libraries, infrastructure, others) can be a problem in a not so mature team. The autonomy means that a team can pick a programming language that was not used before in the company. One needs to be aware that a established language is likely to have a tooling made for it and changing it &ldquo;just-because&rdquo; is most of the times a not reasonable option.</p>
<p>A company that handles a lot of languages also needs a lot of employees with different skill sets which can be a complication in case one employee leaves or wants to change team. Even when I do not agree that one only knows how to code on certain language and needs to start from &ldquo;trainee&rdquo; to learn a new one; there is still a learning curve in order to familiarize with syntax, frameworks and others.</p>
<h2 id="the-ugly">The ugly</h2>
<p>Microservices are not good for a new business in which there are no domain experts to brainstorm with. This, also mentioned in the bad, is something the team needs to work with. A monolith can be split gradually when the business scopes are stable and this can take from months to years.</p>
<p>There is also a change of paradigm in terms on how to test the system. Many teams rely too much on automated E2E (end to end) that covers the entire system. Even when this seems like a good idea, one of the microservices' principles is that the deploy should be independent.
If one has to deploy 10 services into production simultaneously and each time the E2E are executed takes 5 minutes; a total of 50 minutes is going to be spent rerunning the test one after another. This is not scalable on bigger systems and this is why the unit tests (for testing business logic) and integration tests (for testing database, amqp, other APIs) are favoured instead.</p>
<p>Everything needs to be observable and measurable. In a monolith the failure points are easier to detect as everything is on the same application. In a distributed system every service need to have their metrics and alerts in place to know when there is a problem and be prepared to downgrade functionality when this happens. Networks fail, it is not about how to avoid something breaking but how to alert and proceed when it happens.</p>
<p>From sync to async communication. A lot of the operations do not need to happen in batch. This is another change of paradigm. If a customer performs a buying operation it is probably not necessary for the sending of the receipt to happen in sync in the same transaction. For this, one can implement the pattern &ldquo;Tell don&rsquo;t ask&rdquo; where a service tells the other (via an event) that something has happened. This is an async operation that decouples the transaction and that can be retried the amount of times needed. So if the mail service for sending the receipt fails, the buying operation of the customer will not fail and he/she will get the receipt whenever the mail service is working properly again.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The decision of using or not using microservices is going to vary for every company, team and business domain. Thinking cold and establishing what are the advantages and disadvantages that will bring is the best way to start.</p>
<p>Trends are fleeting and whatever today is &ldquo;top notch&rdquo; tomorrow is going to suck. A well informed and <strong>documented</strong> decision is always going to have a good impact.</p>

            <description>The other day I encountered the following post where Seth Vargo was doing some statements regarding the usage of environment variables:
 [&amp;hellip;] While this approach is simple and straightforward, it comes with considerable security drawbacks - the secrets exist in plaintext in the environment. Any other process, library, or dependency running inside the process has access to the environment which has already been exploited multiple times. Unfortunately, it is trivial for a malicious library author to inject this type of vulnerability into an otherwise helpful utility package.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The other day I encountered the <a href="https://www.sethvargo.com/secrets-in-serverless/">following post</a> where Seth Vargo was doing some statements regarding the usage of environment variables:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] While this approach is simple and straightforward, it comes with considerable security drawbacks - the secrets exist in plaintext in the environment. Any other process, library, or dependency running inside the process has access to the environment which has already been exploited multiple times.
Unfortunately, it is trivial for a malicious library author to inject this type of vulnerability into an otherwise helpful utility package.
To be absolutely, unequivocally clear, you should not store secret or sensitive information in environment variables in plaintext.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, the author, states some alternatives like using KMS to cypher values for the environment variables; using <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/berglas">Berglas library</a> and also suggesting Hashicorp Vault.</p>
<p>At the time of that post, GCP was not offering a direct rival to Hashicorp Vault but a few months ago <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/improving-your-security-posture-with-centralized-secrets-management">Google announced Secret Manager being GA</a>.</p>
<p>As of now, at my current workplace we are migrating from a private cloud to GCP and I think there is not a better moment for me to analyze what are the benefits of using Secret Manager and how easy or hard is to make it work.</p>
<h3 id="deploying-resources">Deploying resources</h3>
<p>As some other companies, our workloads are deployed in a Kubernetes cluster (GKE on Google Cloud) while always trying to follow the Principle of Least Access in order to guarantee that a workload can only access to the resources it needs and cannot elevate privileges or modify some other resources.</p>
<p>It only seems fair to do a proof of concept that follows these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a service account with just the IAM (permissions on GCP) needed.</li>
<li>Deploy a GKE cluster using mentioned service account.</li>
<li>Deploy a pod inside that cluster and make sure it can access Secret Manager.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s start.</strong></p>
<p>Make sure the correct project is selected:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From now on, replace pablo-test-project with your GCP project identifier when executing the commands.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">gcloud config set project pablo-test-project
</code></pre></div><p>For accessing Secret Manager API from our Google Kubernetes Engine there are three things that needs to be done.</p>
<h4 id="enable-secret-manager-api">Enable Secret Manager API</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">gcloud services enable secretmanager.googleapis.com
</code></pre></div><p><a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/secretmanager.googleapis.com">Or from the Console UI.</a></p>
<h4 id="set-corresponding-iam-role-on-the-service-account-running-the-instance">Set corresponding IAM role on the service account running the instance</h4>
<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts#service_account_permissions">From service account documentation.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you set up an instance to run as a service account, you determine the level of access the service account has by the IAM roles that you grant to the service account. If the service account has no IAM roles, then no API methods can be run by the service account on that instance.
Furthermore, an instance&rsquo;s access scopes determine the default OAuth scopes for requests made through the gcloud tool and client libraries on the instance. As a result, access scopes potentially further limit access to API methods when authenticating through OAuth. [&hellip;]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to assign the corresponding IAM roles to the service account, the account should be created first:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">gcloud iam service-accounts create demo-service-account <span style="color:#ae81ff">\

</code></pre></div><p>The role to be assigned to this service account is <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#secret-manager-roles">roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor</a> which allows accessing the payload of secrets:</p>

<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/access-control">From access control documentation.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To access the Secret Manager API from within a Compute Engine instance or a Google Kubernetes Engine node (which is also a Compute Engine instance), the instance must have the cloud-platform OAuth scope. For more information about access scopes in Compute Engine, see Service account permissions in the Compute Engine documentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned before, an instance&rsquo;s access scopes determine the default OAuth2 scopes for requests made. So the Kubernetes instance that is going to be created needs the <code>cloud-platform</code> scope. And also don&rsquo;t forget to indicate the service account created before.</p>

</code></pre></div><h3 id="trying-it-out">Trying it out</h3>
<p>In order to try the Secret Manager API an OAuth2 token needs to be issued <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances#applications">as we can read on the documentation.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For some applications, you might need to request an OAuth2 access token and use it directly without going through a client library or using the gcloud or gsutil tools. There are several options for obtaining and using these access tokens to authenticate your applications. [&hellip;]
On the instance where your application runs, query the metadata server for an access token. [&hellip;]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When inside the deployed container:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">curl http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token -H <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Metadata-Flavor: Google&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Since the OAuth2 scopes defined for the instances contains the <code>cloud-platform</code> one, the service account will be able to send requests towards Secret Manager API.</p>
<p>Copy the <code>access_token</code> from the response and execute the following call:</p>
<p><em>Remember to replace pablo-test-project with your project name.</em></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">curl https://content-secretmanager.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/pablo-test-project/secrets/MY_SECRET/versions/latest:access -H <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Authorization&#34;</span>:<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Bearer &lt;access_token&gt;&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The response should look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#f92672">{</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Decoding base64 <code>czNjcjN0</code> is <code>s3cr3t</code>.
This worked fine, but then do we need the IAM permission or is it just enough with the OAuth2 scope?</p>
<p>Remove the IAM permission from the service account:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding pablo-test-project <span style="color:#ae81ff">\

</span><span style="color:#ae81ff"></span>--role<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor
</code></pre></div><p>Wait a minute until the change is propagated and issue the requests again. The response should look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
  <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;error&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#f92672">{</span>
    <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;code&#34;</span>: 403,
    <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;message&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Permission &#39;secretmanager.versions.access&#39; denied for resource &#39;projects/pablo-test-project/secrets/MY_SECRET/versions/latest&#39; (or it may not exist).&#34;</span>,
    <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;status&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;PERMISSION_DENIED&#34;</span>
  <span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
<span style="color:#f92672">}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So effectively, the IAM role is required for this to work. Now, you can add the IAM role again for the next part.</p>
<h3 id="moving-this-to-a-more-realistic-scenario">Moving this to a more realistic scenario</h3>
<p>It is very important not to break the current workflow as this Secret Manager API is probably an overkill for local and dev environment. This is one of the selling points.</p>
<p>For this, I created a <a href="https://github.com/pmorelli92/secret-manager-demo">demo application</a> which is doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expects an environment variable named <code>GCP_PROJECT</code>, if the value is not present then it will try to read the keys from environment and use a default value when an environment variable is not found with the expected name.</li>
<li>If <code>GCP_PROJECT</code> is defined, it will try to search the secret on Secret Manager. If the value is not found there it will use a default value as well.</li>
<li>The application listens on the port <code>8080</code> and exposes the following route <code>GET /get-secret</code> expecting the header <code>secret: &lt;secret-name&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the next section, this application is explained but for now we can just add it do the cluster:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml"><span style="color:#ae81ff">cat &lt;&lt;EOF | kubectl apply -f -</span>

<ul>
<li>(+) Secret Manager has a very intuitive API which also has some nice dedicated UI for developers to access secrets (if they also have the required IAM), see key versions and configure policies for expiration.</li>
<li>(+) Moving away from storing secrets on plain text on environment variables is also a correct step in order to secure our applications.</li>
<li>(+) Having the possibility to implement this in a way where it does not interfere with the local environment is one of the selling points.</li>
<li>(-) Vendor lockdown. It is understandable that this product is not directly interchangeable. That being said there are alternatives like Hashicorp Vault that also offers the same (and maybe more) functionality. However, it is clear that if you are on GCP you have already invested time on using cloud specific built-in solutions like CloudSQL and Cloud Storage which are not directly interchangeable either.</li>

            <description>Some days ago a coworker of mine linked me to the source code of Google&amp;rsquo;s exposure notifications API and of course is a good chance to see how Google is doing Go related codebases.
Continuing with the topic of Postgres and benchmarking, I decided to check out how Postgres configuration was done and this line got my attention:
import ( ... &amp;#34;github.com/jackc/pgx/v4/pgxpool&amp;#34; ) What is pgx, and why should we care?</description>

<p><code>Pgx</code> is a library that implements postgres connection without relying on the <code>database/sql</code> standard package. The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/jackc/pgx">here</a>; and as the readme states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pgx aims to be low-level, fast, and performant, while also enabling PostgreSQL-specific features that the standard database/sql package does not allow for.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>pgx supports many features beyond what is available through database/sql:</p>
<ul>
<li>[&hellip;]</li>
<li>Automatic statement preparation and caching</li>
<li>Batch queries</li>
<li>Single-round trip query mode</li>
<li>Connection pool with after-connect hook for arbitrary connection setup</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Automatic statement preparation and caching - pgx will prepare and cache statements by default. This can provide an significant free improvement to code that does not explicitly use prepared statements. Under certain workloads, it can perform nearly 3x the number of queries per second.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Batched queries - Multiple queries can be batched together to minimize network round trips.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And these are just a bunch of things picked from the readme, but there are some strong statements which are analyzed below to see if they are true or not.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarking">Benchmarking</h2>
<p>On my previous post <a href="https://devandchill.com/posts/2020/05/postgres-benchmarking-concurrently-safe-upsert-queries/">Benchmarking concurrently safe upsert queries</a> I showed an application using <code>lib/pq</code> and benchmark for different queries, all trying to solve the same scenario. In order not to make the post larger than necessary, please check the details on the link above.</p>
<p>In this post, the application shown before will be used and we will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to migrate from lib/pq to pgx.</li>
<li>Compare the benchmark between both.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without further ado, let&rsquo;s begin.</p>
<h2 id="connection-handling">Connection handling</h2>
<p>On the <code>lib/pq</code> version, <code>database/sql</code> is being used to create a struct holding a <code>*sql.Db</code> variable which was being used for every call to the database.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Since the idea is to try out the pooling mechanism, a pool configuration is created and used for the connection. This is fairly simple, but there is more than just that in the code.</p>
<p>The function <code>AfterConnect</code> allows the developer to hook custom behaviors into the database connection. As for this example a custom mapping is added to map a <code>TID</code> field to a string. <code>TID</code> is the Postgres type we get when we query <code>SELECT ctid</code>.</p>
<p>It is understandable that a real world application will not fetch this type of data thus the mapping was not implemented. For this <a href="https://github.com/jackc/pgtype/pull/29">I&rsquo;ve submitted a PR</a> but it did not reach a release tag at the moment I am writing this; so I added the custom hook in the code.</p>
<p>Again, in a real world application it is likely that an <code>AfterConnect</code> hook is not needed, but it is valuable knowing that you can use it if you need it.</p>
<p>With the connection covered, let&rsquo;s move to the queries:</p>
<h3 id="advisory-lock">Advisory Lock</h3>
<p>The changes to the code are barely there. All of the <code>pgx</code> functions that go against the database expect a <code>context</code> and there is none non-context alternative.</p>

<h2 id="upsert-do-nothing">Upsert do nothing</h2>
<p>As you can recall (if you read my previous post), there is a limitation when sending on the same <code>QueryContext</code> more than one parameterized query.</p>
<p>On the previous post, this was bypassed by a non good practice that was not sending parameterized queries but injecting the string; which as I stated previously it is a bad practice that can led to security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>But on <code>pgx</code> there is a built-in support for sending a query batch in a single trip. And this definitely draw my attention since I find this approach the easiest to understand a.k.a <code>write first, read later</code>.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my previous post I covered how to <a href="https://devandchill.com/posts/2020/02/postgres-building-concurrently-safe-upsert-queries">build concurrently safe upsert queries</a>.</p>
<p>This post serves as a continuation where different approaches will be battle tested to expose the performance of each one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advisory lock</li>
<li>On conflict update</li>
<li>On conflict do nothing</li>
<li>CTE queries</li>
</ul>
<p>Without further ado, let&rsquo;s start:</p>
<h2 id="the-application">The application</h2>
<p>In order to emulate the scenario described on the previous post, an HTTP API is required. This one will connect to a database to perform the calls.
The application is written in Go and can be found <a href="https://github.com/pmorelli92/pg-upsert-returning">here</a>.</p>
<p>The application is plain simple, as it contains few files:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>cmd/main.go</em>: Responsible for bootstrapping the postgres connection and http server.</li>
<li><em>server/server.go</em>: Exposes different endpoints, performs body parsing and error checking.</li>
<li><em>domain/domain.go</em>: Exposes the <code>UpsertedRow</code> struct that will be returned by postgres.</li>
<li><em>postgres/postgres.go</em>: Contains functions for each approach listed above, all with the same signature so they can be consumed easily on the server file. Yes, on an a real world app, do not inject database handlers directly on the transport layer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h2>
<p>Since we are going to use postgres, an instance needs to be set up, and for convenience this example uses docker:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">docker run --name db -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>trust postgres:latest
</code></pre></div><p>A file named <code>seed.psql</code> is also present on the root of the repository:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span style="color:#66d9ef">CREATE</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">DATABASE</span> customer_svc;
<span style="color:#66d9ef">CREATE</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">TABLE</span> customers(id SERIAL, customer_id UUID <span style="color:#66d9ef">NOT</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">NULL</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">PRIMARY</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">KEY</span>);
</code></pre></div><h2 id="running-the-application">Running the application</h2>
<p>The application can be run in a container as well:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">docker build -t pg-upsert-app:local .
docker run -p 8080:8080 --link db --name app -i pg-upsert-app:local
</code></pre></div><h2 id="benchmarking">Benchmarking</h2>
<p>For the benchmark, the tool <a href="https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta">vegeta</a> is used. This tool allows doing HTTP load testing which will be used against the API.</p>
<p>The test suite is just a bash script that will feature a similar logic for each approach to be tested; example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">UPSERT_LOCK<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">$(</span>echo <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;{

</span><span style="color:#e6db74">}&#39;</span> | sed <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;s/&lt;ruuid&gt;/</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">$(</span>uuidgen | tr <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;[:upper:]&#39;</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;[:lower:]&#39;</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">)</span><span style="color:#e6db74">/g&#34;</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">)</span>
echo <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;EXECUTING FOR LOCKS&#34;</span>
jq -ncM <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>$UPSERT_LOCK<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">\

</code></pre></div><p>This is translated to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Echo a <code>POST</code> request towards <code>http://app:8080/upsert-lock</code> with the payload <code>{&quot;id&quot;: &quot;some-uuid-generated-at-runtime&quot;}</code>. This uuid will be repeated for each call performed in the given scenario.</li>
<li>Parse this echoed string as a json, and use it as an input for vegeta tool.</li>
<li>Execute requests for 40 seconds with 20 concurrent connections at a rate of 100 request per second; in other words 4000 request distributed across 20 connections for 40 seconds.</li>
<li>The results will be aggregated into different buckets determined by <code>hist[0,2ms,4ms,6ms,8ms,10ms,15ms]</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The execution of this test is also dockerized so there is no need to download additional tools:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">docker build -t benchmark:local -f benchmark/Dockerfile benchmark/.
docker run --link app -t benchmark:local
</code></pre></div><p>In order to avoid results influenced by the warm up phase of the app, the test suite was executed twice and only the results from the last execution are shown below.</p>
<h2 id="advisory-lock">Advisory lock</h2>
<p>As the previous post indicates this approach is the less scalable. The introduction of a custom application lock in the database is not a good design model and the results are showing that:</p>

<p>This one is most likely the most common solution for these kind of cases. The results are better than the previous one but it is still not a good design.</p>
<p>Remember, updating on conflict will cause the following side effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Old row is removed, a new is added.</li>
<li>It modifies the row transaction id, an &ldquo;old&rdquo; that got updated row will have a new transaction timestamp.</li>
<li>Firing triggers affecting the table.</li>

<h2 id="upsert-do-nothing">Upsert do nothing</h2>
<p>The following approach has its pros and cons. The pros are that there are no side effects being caused in the database, and the application is not doing any kind of locking. This approach can be referred to write first, read later.</p>
<p>There are two ways to achieve this technique:</p>
<ul>
<li>Same batch, write then read, one roundtrip.</li>
<li>Two batches, first one: write, second one: read, two round trips.</li>
</ul>
<p>If two batches are going to be used, the performance will end up being somewhat like the locking scenario, since there is a need of going several times to the database.</p>
<p>The example displayed below shows how to achieve it in only one batch; but then again this is part of the cons. By nature Postgres does not allow sending two parameterized query statements on the same batch; so the parameters should be resolved before sending the query which can led to SQL injection.</p>
<p>The example below shows how to bypass Postgres limit avoiding parameters; but this is not a good practice, as it can introduce security vulnerabilities in case we are dealing with parameters like strings.</p>

<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p>In this post different approaches were battle tested; there is no holy grail or golden rule when it comes to database modelling.</p>
<p>The results showed here do not indicate that your project has to use CTE queries. Always the healthier approach is to ask yourself and the team:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we have this problem?</li>
<li>Why do we have this problem?</li>
<li>Is there anything we can do to get rid of this problem?</li>
<li>Brainstorm session, avoid premature optimization, avoid over engineering.</li>
<li>Take a decision.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping this in mind, will probably avoid falling into design traps or solutions that were not needed in the first place.</p>
<p>As a last sentence, if you consider this is useful, do not hesitate on sharing this on your favorite social media. See you next time!</p>

            <description>Recently at the company I am working for, there was a need to communicate with an external service which required us to send some data along with an integer identifier. The problem is that IDs in our domain are not integers but uuid.
The suggestion then was to have a service which creates an unique integer for a certain uuid. This way the int identifier won&amp;rsquo;t be leaked to any other part of the system.</description>

<li>Internal system does a request to external service sending the int ID.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is fairly simple, but lets go through some more elaborated preconditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>For x uuid there will always be a unique y int.</li>
<li>If the int representation is not created, create it.</li>
<li>If the int representation is created, return it.</li>
<li>The code should be concurrently safe.</li>

<p>Same scenario than the one detailed above, but starting a transaction before executing the <code>SELECT</code>, and committing after the insert succeed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, transaction is not going to help in any way here. The <code>SELECT</code> will not lock any row because no row exists and this is not exactly the way Postgres handles locking. This means that two <code>SELECT</code> at the same time will not cause the latest to wait until the first transaction is committed.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>What is the definition of <code>ctid</code>, <code>xmin</code> and <code>xmax</code>, and why do they keep increasing?
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/ddl-system-columns.html">Documentation</a></p>
<p><strong>ctid</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The physical location of the row version within its table. Note that although the ctid can be used to locate the row version very quickly, a row&rsquo;s ctid will change if it is updated or moved by VACUUM FULL. Therefore ctid is useless as a long-term row identifier. A primary key should be used to identify logical rows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>xmin</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The identity (transaction ID) of the inserting transaction for this row version. (A row version is an individual state of a row; each update of a row creates a new row version for the same logical row.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>xmax</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The identity (transaction ID) of the deleting transaction, or zero for an undeleted row version. It is possible for this column to be nonzero in a visible row version. That usually indicates that the deleting transaction hasn&rsquo;t committed yet, or that an attempted deletion was rolled back.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ctid</code> is the tuple id composed by <code>(page, item)</code>.</li>
<li><code>xmin</code> is the creation transaction id of that row.</li>
<li><code>xmax</code> is the destruction transaction id of that row.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to elaborate it is important to take into consideration the MVCC (Multiversion Concurrency Control) nature of postgres. From the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/mvcc-intro.html">Documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each SQL statement sees a snapshot of data [&hellip;] regardless of the current state of the underlying data. This prevents statements from viewing inconsistent data produced by concurrent transactions performing updates on the same data rows. [&hellip;] MVCC, minimizes lock contention in order to allow for reasonable performance in multiuser environments.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The main advantage of using the MVCC model of concurrency control rather than locking is [&hellip;] reading never blocks writing and writing never blocks reading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With that explained, lets introduce how an UPDATE works on postgres:</p>

<p>Every company has a different way to work and configure CI/CD, and all of them have pros and cons. I&rsquo;ve worked with Azure Pipelines before (but when it was called VSTS and the configuration was done in a more visual way and not with yaml files). Now I am currently working with Travis for CI and Flux for CD but I think it is always good to keep an eye on how the competitors are doing and what they have to offer.</p>
<p>For this tutorial, I only had to link my github account to Azure Devops in order to use its functionality. That being said, I did not have to put my credit card or billing information so it is safe to say that it is free, at least for hobby usages.</p>
<p>The tutorial will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go application with Dockerfile</li>
<li>Build and push to Dockerhub (but it could be any other docker registry)</li>
<li>Deploy to Okteto (which offers a free kubernetes cluster)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-application">The application</h2>
<p>You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/pmorelli92/go-with-azure">GitHub</a>. It is a rather simple rest application since the purpose here is not to dig into code but on the CI/CD.</p>
<p>It is runnable (downloading modules first with <code>go mod download</code>) executing <code>go run cmd/main.go</code>.
The only functionality that exposes is a <code>GET /health</code> endpoint which will return a json informing that health is ok.</p>
<p>The application can be dockerized executing <code>docker build -t gwa:local .</code> and then runnable using <code>docker run -p 80:8080 -it gwa:local</code>.</p>
<p>The file <code>azure-pipelines.yml</code> contains the CI/CD configuration but more on that later.</p>
<h2 id="azure-devops">Azure Devops</h2>
<p>An account is needed in order to get access on Azure Pipelines. Linking the github account and giving access to the demo repository should be enough, after this step a project should be set up.</p>
<p>Inside the project, the project settings button should be visible on the bottom left corner.
Scroll down to service connections and you should see something like this:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/posts/images/project-settings.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>This is where the credentials for docker and kubernetes are stored.</p>
<p>Select docker registry and complete the steps for docker.</p>
<p>For kubernetes it should be enough selecting Kubeconfig and pasting the kube config that lives under <code>user/.kube/config</code> on the operating system. Beware, in case you have multiple configurations, remove the parts that are not related to the cluster in which you want to deploy.</p>
<h2 id="adding-build-pipeline">Adding build pipeline</h2>
<p>Under the pipeline menu, pick <code>build</code> and <code>add a new pipeline</code>. Follow the steps and give access to the repository (it does not matter if it is public or private). Pick starter pipeline when prompted and proceed to click save and run.</p>
<p>If everything went well a commit should be added to the repository and this will appear on the commit history of the repository:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/posts/images/built-commit.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>The ✔️ indicates that the CI process ran successfully, when the build is ongoing a yellow circle will appear, and if the build fails ❌ will be shown.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-cicd">Configuring CI/CD</h2>
<p>Back to the azure-pipelines.yml:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>A discussion could be hold on whether if a service should self contain information of deployment or be agnostic of it. As a personal preference, I think having everything related to the application on the same repository enables easier discoverability.</p>
<p>Of course, we are not having any secrets here, if that was the case, Azure Pipelines offers a way to store them safely inside the azure devops project.</p>
<p>That being said, the repository contains a <a href="https://github.com/pmorelli92/go-with-azure/blob/master/kubernetes/k8s-deployment.yml">file</a> <code>kubernetes/k8s-deployment.yml</code> which describes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deployment (information of the containers to be run)</li>
<li>Service (enables communication from pods)</li>
<li>Ingress (enables communication from the outside world to the service)</li>
</ul>
<p>The deployment needs to specify which version of the docker image is going to be run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yml" data-lang="yml"><span style="color:#f92672">spec</span>:

    <span style="color:#f92672">containerPort</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">80</span>
</code></pre></div><p>It is definitely not good to use <code>:latest</code> image on stage / production so the sed script will replace <code>:latest</code> with <code>0.0.X</code> (which will be the build number). This is also the same version that will be pushed to the selected docker registry: <a href="https://cloud.docker.com/u/pmorelli92/repository/docker/pmorelli92/go-with-azure">example</a>.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Finally, <code>kubernetesServiceConnection</code> is for indicating the connection created on the project settings; the namespace refers to a kubernetes namespace, and the command combined with arguments will be the equivalent of: <code>kubectl apply -f kubernetes/k8s-deployment.yml</code></p>
<p>This will create / update the specifications that are living on the folder or file; in this case: the deployment, service and ingress.</p>
<p>An additional resource: a cronjob was added. This is because Okteto takes down applications without activity in 24 hours. With this cronjob every minute we are curling the app so it stays online.</p>
<p>If everything goes green, we can check that the pod version matches the latest one added on the docker registry.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/posts/images/pod-version.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>The logs should display something like this:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/posts/images/cicd-logs.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>And the demo app is now accessible from the following <a href="https://gwa-service-pmorelli92.cloud.okteto.net/health">link</a>.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In this tutorial we have seen how easy it is to set up a quick CI/CD pipeline that could be improved further according to the business / technical needs.
If I were to give a verdict on Azure Pipelines:</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides support for CI/CD.</li>
<li>Component of Azure Devops which also supplies: git repos, agile boards and reports.</li>
<li>Free to start, specially for startups.</li>
<li>Documentation is clear and updated.</li>
<li>Backed by Microsoft.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Vendor lock in with some commands, that would need to be refactored in order to change CI/CD provider.</li>
</ul>

            <description>The newly released dotnet 3 preview 6 has an interesting feature called publish single file where an application can be published as a self contained app that will extract and run on the platform it was compiled for.
In order to add this feature in our .csproj, add the following lines:
&amp;lt;PropertyGroup&amp;gt; &amp;lt;TargetFramework&amp;gt;netcoreapp3.0&amp;lt;/TargetFramework&amp;gt; &amp;lt;PublishTrimmed&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/PublishTrimmed&amp;gt; &amp;lt;PublishReadyToRun&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/PublishReadyToRun&amp;gt; &amp;lt;PublishSingleFile&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/PublishSingleFile&amp;gt; &amp;lt;CrossGenDuringPublish&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/CrossGenDuringPublish&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/PropertyGroup&amp;gt; There are some flags that may sound weird, let&amp;rsquo;s go through them:</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The newly released <code>dotnet 3 preview 6</code> has an interesting feature called <code>publish single file</code> where an application can be published as a <code>self contained app</code> that will <strong>extract and run</strong> on the platform it was compiled for.</p>
<p>In order to add this feature in our <code>.csproj</code>, add the following lines:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span style="color:#f92672">&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;</span>

  <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;PublishTrimmed&gt;</span>true<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/PublishTrimmed&gt;</span>
  <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;PublishReadyToRun&gt;</span>true<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/PublishReadyToRun&gt;</span>
  <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;PublishSingleFile&gt;</span>true<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/PublishSingleFile&gt;</span>

<span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>There are some flags that may sound weird, let&rsquo;s go through them:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PublishTrimmed</code> indicates to remove all the dotnet dependencies that are not being used by our code. When doing this in a real world application, it is very important to test it afterwards in case some dependency that is referenced by code (for example using reflection) is being trimmed as well.</li>
<li><code>PublishReadyToRun</code> it is supposed to make the start time of our application faster, but in the process it will make the binary heavier.</li>
<li><code>CrossGenDuringPublish</code> is a workaround that needs to be present for indicating the machine that is running the publish, that it should not bother with compilation for other RID (more about this below)</li>
</ul>
<p>After these flags had been set, the application is runnable using:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">dotnet publish -r osx-x64 -c Release -o ./deploy
./deploy/&lt;APP_NAME&gt; &lt;- Execute the application
</code></pre></div><p>When publishing a single file, don&rsquo;t forget to add the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog">runtime identifier catalog (RID)</a> corresponding to the platform where the application is going to be run. For example: <code>-r osx-x64</code></p>
<p>With the basics of this feature already covered, let&rsquo;s move to the important bit.</p>
<h2 id="deploy-application-on-an-alpine-based-container">Deploy application on an Alpine based container</h2>
<p>One important win using this approach is that the published binary does not need to be run in a container that has dotnet runtime installed. But one caveat for consideration is that those internal dependencies used under the hood by dotnet are still needed. There are two options:</p>

<p>Then the result files (the binary and a single DLL) are copied to an alpine container only having dotnet runtime dependencies.</p>
<p>At the end the <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> line is executed. Check that this one is not doing <code>dotnet app/&lt;APP_NAME&gt;</code> but just <code>./app/&lt;APP_NAME&gt;</code></p>
<p>I did a sample API with this approach, <a href="https://github.com/pmorelli92/dotnet3.executable.api">which can be found my github</a>. The container weighted <code>91MB</code>, used <code>30MB RAM</code> and <code>0.08% CPU</code>. Awesome, right?</p>

            <description>Generally speaking, most organisations do not check if a commit is signed or not. Even worse, more companies do not care about this. It might subjective but I like to have the verified badge.
  If you commit from GitHub, for example: adding or editing a README, you will get the verified bagde. The same will happen with the client GitKraken, but if you commit using the git cli this will not happen unless you configure it.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Generally speaking, most organisations do not check if a commit is signed or not. Even worse, more companies do not care about this. It might subjective but I like to have the <code>verified</code> badge.</p>

</figure>

<p>If you commit from GitHub, for example: adding or editing a README, you will get the verified bagde. The same will happen with the client <code>GitKraken</code>, but if you commit using the <code>git cli</code> this will not happen unless you configure it.</p>
<p>Now, I will assume that you are using a mac but in case you do not, you can google yourself some of the installation steps.</p>
<h2 id="installing-gpg">Installing GPG</h2>
<p>In order to sign a commit you will need to generate a key, and for this you are going to use <a href="https://gnupg.org/">GPG</a>. But first, you need brew to be installed, if you do not have it yet, it is a must have package manager for mac that you can download <a href="https://brew.sh/">here</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&gt; brew install gnupg
&gt; brew install pinentry-mac
&gt; echo <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac&#34;</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
&gt; killall gpg-agent
</code></pre></div><p><a href="https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/pinentry/index.en.html">Pinentry</a> as it is stated on the GPG site it is a collection of dialogs that allows you, for example, to input the passphrase of the private key. In order for this to work we need to indicate the path where it is installed into the GPG configuration and then kill the service (just in case) for it to take the changes.</p>
<h2 id="generating-a-set-of-keys">Generating a set of keys</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&gt; gpg --full-generate-key
<span style="color:#f92672">(</span>you can customise the key creation or just press enter to use the defaults<span style="color:#f92672">)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Will generate a private key from which you are going to generate and export the public key. The id of the key will be shown when you generate the key or you can fetch it by running:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&gt; gpg --list-secret-keys
</code></pre></div><p>And you will get something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sec   rsa2048 2019-06-07 <span style="color:#f92672">[</span>SC<span style="color:#f92672">]</span>
      KEY_ID_HERE
uid   <span style="color:#f92672">[</span>  absolut <span style="color:#f92672">]</span> Pablo Morelli &lt;devandchill@gmail.com&gt;
ssb   rsa2048 2019-06-07 <span style="color:#f92672">[</span>E<span style="color:#f92672">]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>After you have your ID, execute:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&gt; gpg --export --armor YOUR_KEY_ID 2&gt; cat
</code></pre></div><p>You will see the public key on the terminal, now you can copy it and go to GitHub.</p>
<h2 id="adding-public-key-to-github-account">Adding public key to GitHub account</h2>
<p>Go to <code>Settings -&gt; SSH and GPG Keys -&gt; New GPG Key</code> and paste the content of your key and after submiting you will see something like this.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/posts/images/gpg-github.png"/> 
</figure>

<h2 id="doing-your-first-verified-commit">Doing your first verified commit</h2>
<p>When you work with the <code>git cli</code> there is a huge probability that you work with different accounts (for example one for work and one personal) and/or that you have more than one GPG key on your system.
To avoid problems with git not knowing which configuration to pick you will indicate that for the repo where you are standing or for all the repos you will use the GPG key that contains a certain ID.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&gt; git config --local gpg.program <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;gpg&#34;</span>
&gt; git config --local user.signingKey <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;YOUR_KEY_ID_INSIDE_THE_QUOTES&#34;</span> // will apply to the working directory

&gt; git config --global gpg.program <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;gpg&#34;</span>
&gt; git config --global user.signingKey <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;YOUR_KEY_ID_INSIDE_THE_QUOTES&#34;</span> // will apply to the all the repositories except when overriden
</code></pre></div><p>You are almost ready to go, but you need to know that by default <code>git commit</code> does not sign the commits unless you specify the argument <code>-S</code>. So you have two options:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&gt; git commit -S -m <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;My commit message&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Or you can setup automatic signing for the repository or all the repositories.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&gt; git config --local commit.gpgsign <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;true&#34;</span>

&gt; git config --global commit.gpgsign <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;true&#34;</span> // <span style="color:#66d9ef">if</span> you want to set up <span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> all the repositories
</code></pre></div><p>If you did the step above, the argument <code>-S</code> is no longer needed.</p>
<h2 id="checking-git-configuration">Checking git configuration</h2>
<p>When you are unsure about your configuration you can execute <code>git config --local -l</code> to list the configuration for the working directory and you should see something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">gpg.program<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>gpg
commit.gpgsign<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>true
user.signingkey<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>YOUR_KEY_ID
</code></pre></div><h2 id="back-up-your-private-key">Back up your private key</h2>
<p>Keys are passwords, so you should save them somewhere safe and revoke + change periodically.
It is trivial to revoke and to generate a new key for GitHub but it may be troublesome for some other systems that uses your public key.
Now lets image that you change your computer, you wont be able to sign because you don&rsquo;t have your key; in this case a backup is recommended.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">gpg --export-secret-keys YOUR_KEY_ID &gt; some_private_key_name
</code></pre></div><p>Now you can save this file to some secure vault, and if you ever need to import it on a new machine, execute:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">gpg --import some_private_key_name
</code></pre></div><h2 id="bonus-track">Bonus track</h2>
<p>As I mentioned before, some times when you work using the <code>git cli</code> you end up mixing accounts, and it could happen to commit like this:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/posts/images/incorrect-user.png"/> 
</figure>

<p>You can of course leave it like that or do a rebase of the commit; but you can also check first using <code>git config --local -l</code> which is the <code>user.name</code> and <code>user.email</code> for that working directory.
In case the email does not match with the email linked in GitHub you can change it doing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&gt; git config --local user.name <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;GitHub name&#34;</span>
&gt; git config --local user.email <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;my.github@email.com&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>I hope you liked the post, if so, don&rsquo;t forget to share it so this can reach to more people :)</p>

 Print on console all the words and the quantity of times they appear on a 40.000 lines input. Make it as fast as possible.  For a start one can do it as simple as possible instead, and then try to see whether it can be made faster:

</code></pre></div><p>The differences in this snippet and the first one are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>We defined a <code>WaitGroup</code> that will allow us to:
<ul>
<li>Add a counter every time a goroutine is fired.</li>
<li>Block the main goroutine with the <code>wg.Wait()</code> until all the other goroutines are finished.</li>
<li><em>Decrease</em> the counter executing <code>wg.Done()</code> every time a goroutine is finished.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We put the functionality that is going to be executed for each word in an <code>anonymous function</code>. So now, we can use the word <code>go</code> to execute that function in a different goroutine.</li>
</ol>
<p>Does this work? Unfortunately no. If we execute the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&gt; go run main.go --race
fatal error: concurrent map read and map write
</code></pre></div><p>Basically the race detector is telling us that some of the goroutines can execute this line at the same moment:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="color:#a6e22e">words</span>[<span style="color:#a6e22e">w2</span>]<span style="color:#f92672">++</span>
</code></pre></div><p>If the map does not want to be written at the same time by two different goroutines we should use some sort of <code>queue</code> and then consume the values in a single threaded process. Fortunately, Go have us covered with <code>channels</code>.</p>
<p>Doing the following modifications should work:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Now if we run this algorithm we will see that is not failing anymore. Let’s then move to benchmarking.</p>
<h2 id="benchmark">Benchmark</h2>
<p>We are going to do this in two different ways: executing the idiomatic Go benchmark and using the command-line utility <code>time</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&gt; go test -run<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>XXX -bench<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>.
</code></pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">BenchmarkWordCounter-12               <span style="color:#ae81ff">45</span>   25.88 ms/op   <span style="color:#ae81ff">4354027</span> B/op   <span style="color:#ae81ff">124918</span> allocs/op
BenchmarkWordCounterConcurrent-12     <span style="color:#ae81ff">19</span>   59.70 ms/op   <span style="color:#ae81ff">5711640</span> B/op   <span style="color:#ae81ff">138290</span> allocs/op
</code></pre></div><p>This is telling us that the sync version executed <code>45 times</code> and each execution took approx <code>25.88 milliseconds</code>, meanwhile in the same time the concurrent version only got executed <code>19 times</code> because each execution took approx <code>59.70 milliseconds</code>.</p>
<p>Wait, What?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&gt; go build
&gt; time ./go-word-counter
</code></pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#f92672">(</span>SYNC<span style="color:#f92672">)</span>
./go-word-counter  0.04s user 0.00s system 89% cpu 0.050 total
<span style="color:#f92672">(</span>CONCURRENT<span style="color:#f92672">)</span>
./go-word-counter  0.46s user 0.13s system 486% cpu 0.120 total
</code></pre></div><p>So the sync version takes approx <code>0.050</code> and <code>89% cpu</code> and the concurrent one <code>0.120</code> and <code>486% cpu</code>.</p>
<p>We are sure that the function is running concurrently (hence the CPU usage), but shouldn&rsquo;t that mean it has to run faster? Well, no.</p>
<p>Looking at the code one can see that the parts that get executed inside the word goroutines takes less to execute than all the orchestration needed for pulling a word from a channel.</p>
<p>Things would be different if an sleep was added:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="color:#a6e22e">w1</span> = <span style="color:#a6e22e">strings</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">ToLower</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">w1</span>)
<span style="color:#a6e22e">w1</span> = <span style="color:#a6e22e">removeSpecial</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">ReplaceAllString</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">w1</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;&#34;</span>)
<span style="color:#a6e22e">time</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">Sleep</span>(<span style="color:#ae81ff">200</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>And then the benchmark:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">BenchmarkWordCounter-12                <span style="color:#ae81ff">3</span>   425.23 ms/op   <span style="color:#ae81ff">4436128</span> B/op   <span style="color:#ae81ff">124934</span> allocs/op

</code></pre></div><p>In this scenario is visible how the concurrent way outperforms the sync one.</p>
<p>So we started with a single goroutine algorithm, we evolved it to run using more than one goroutine and having an orchestration for the algorithm to work. At the end we did a benchmark and compared the results.</p>
<p>The value we can get out of this is to avoid <code>premature optimization</code>, how to <code>KISS</code> (keep it simple and stupid) and the most important one: We learned that concurrent flows are beneficial when the code inside the goroutine is CPU/time intensive.</p>

<li>Create a new scanner for the stream.</li>
<li>Make the scanner split the stream on the criteria selected.</li>

<p>The <code>scanner.Split(...)</code> instead of using <code>bufio.ScanWords</code> is using an implementation that takes care of splitting the words when punctuation happens since the default implementation do not consider these cases. This can be found on my repository linked below.</p>

            <description>When I started learning Golang (a couple of months ago) one of the things that I concerned most with was the project structure.
It may sound irrelevant to bother with this when you are learning the language; but, every time I am browsing .net core applications or libraries on GitHub, I find it extremely unappealing when certain projects are not structured in a conventional way.
My starting point was the following talk:</description>

<p>It may sound irrelevant to bother with this when you are learning the language; but, every time I am browsing .net core applications or libraries on GitHub, I find it extremely unappealing when certain projects are not structured in a conventional way.</p>
<p>My starting point was the following talk:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oL6JBUk6tj0" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Being that I did not know how to manage dependencies, I started investigating and saw that lots of people were using <code>dep</code>, and how bad could it be?</p>
<p>I started building a sample app that that could be containerised (again, just to see how the Dockerfile would look like), and the following happened:</p>

</span></code></pre></div><p>That Dockerfile, as ugly as it looks, was the result of some iterations were I was getting path errors, dependency errors, and others. The constraint of only working on <code>GOPATH</code> gave me headaches and I had to use a really bad <code>WORKDIR</code> as you can see above.</p>
<p>But then after some searching, I came across that <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules">GO Modules</a> was supported from version 1.11, so I decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>And this is how the Dockerfile looks like now:</p>

</span></code></pre></div><p>We can achieve the same using <code>golang:1.11</code> but we wil have to execute an additional step <code>ENV GO111MODULE=on</code> before <code>RUN go mod download</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Things to remember</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both go.mod and <code>go.sum</code> have to be committed.</li>
<li>When building a docker file, in order to take advantage of the layered cache steps, we should first copy <code>go.mod</code> and <code>go.sum</code> and then executing <code>RUN go mod download</code>; after that, we can safely copy our code.</li>
