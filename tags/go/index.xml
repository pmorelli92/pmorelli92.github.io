      <description>One of the things that shocked me the most when I changed from C# to Golang is that developers are reluctant of adding libraries to solve problems unless it is strictly needed. This sentiment, at first annoying, turned out to be one of the things I liked the most about Go. The standard library alone is very powerful and you can achieve most of the stuff just with it.
However, there was a little something that my mind keep thinking: it would be super good to have swagger docs out of the box like in C#.</description>

      <description>Some days ago a coworker of mine linked me to the source code of Google&amp;rsquo;s exposure notifications API and of course is a good chance to see how Google is doing Go related codebases.
Continuing with the topic of Postgres and benchmarking, I decided to check out how Postgres configuration was done and this line got my attention:
import ( ... &amp;#34;github.com/jackc/pgx/v4/pgxpool&amp;#34; ) What is pgx, and why should we care?</description>

      <description>In my previous post I covered how to build concurrently safe upsert queries .
This post serves as a continuation where different approaches will be battle tested to expose the performance of each one:
 Advisory lock On conflict update On conflict do nothing CTE queries  Without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s start:
The application In order to emulate the scenario described on the previous post, an HTTP API is required. This one will connect to a database to perform the calls.</description>

      <description>2021 update: Since KubeSail was not working as expected, the solution is now hosted in Okteto which offers a free namespace for developers to try out a hosted Kubernetes service.
Every company has a different way to work and configure CI/CD, and all of them have pros and cons. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with Azure Pipelines before (but when it was called VSTS and the configuration was done in a more visual way and not with yaml files).</description>

      <title>Word counter: Sync, concurrent or streams?</title>

      <description>One day I was given the task of doing a whiteboard word counter algorithm. The requirements were:
 Print on console all the words and the quantity of times they appear on a 40.000 lines input. Make it as fast as possible.  For a start one can do it as simple as possible instead, and then try to see whether it can be made faster:
func wordCounter() (words map[string]int) { b, err := ioutil.</description>

      <description>When I started learning Golang (a couple of months ago) one of the things that I concerned most with was the project structure.
It may sound irrelevant to bother with this when you are learning the language; but, every time I am browsing .net core applications or libraries on GitHub, I find it extremely unappealing when certain projects are not structured in a conventional way.
My starting point was the following talk:</description>
